        The Football Statistics Applet provides league tables, results, form tables, sequences and
        head-to-head analysis for league football competitions.  It can be embedded in a web page to
        provide fast, low-maintenance statistics.  It is an entirely client-side solution and will
        work with any web hosting package (there is no need for a servlet container or database server).

        <dt><strong>Updated Source Code</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          For version 3.0, the applet's source code has been
          <a href="http://blog.uncommons.org/2008/06/20/java-archaeology/">brought
          up-to-date</a> and now takes advantage of modern Java features (Java 5.0
          rather than 1.1).
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>Improved User Interface</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          Because it targeted Java 1.1, the original applet could not use Swing for its user
          interface.  Instead it had to use the limited components provided by AWT.  Version
          3.0 uses Swing, providing a much richer user experience.
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>Better Graphs</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          Moving to Swing means we now use the excellent
          <a href="http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/">JFreeChart</a> library for graphs rather
          than the rather basic and ugly custom AWT charts used in version 2.
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>Compressed Data Files</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          Data files can now optionally use GZip compression to reduce their size by up to 80%.
          This reduces the amount of data transferred by your web server and makes things
          noticeably faster for users on slow connections.
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>Internationalisation</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          Prior to version 3, FSA was only available in English.  Java.net user <tt>maty535</tt>
          has implemented i18n support and provided an initial translation into Slovak.  If you
          would like to see FSA in your language, you can provide your own translations (please
          submit your efforts via a pull request on GitHub).
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>More Detailed Sequence Statistics</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          The software now displays a list of all of the results that contributed to a particular
          sequence.  Additionally, there is a new sequence that tracks the number of matches since
          a team last kept a cleansheet.
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>Support for Split Leagues</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          Previous versions of the software did not work properly for the Scottish Premier League
          (and similar leagues such as Northern Ireland's IFA Premiership) because the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Premier_League#Competition_format">split
          format</a> permits teams to finish above others that have more points.  Version 3.0
          allows you to specify that the league will split in half after a certain number of games.
